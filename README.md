# Dhumavati Theme

A dark, skeudomorphic/neumorphic GTK3 theme which is part of the Electric Tantra Linux.

> If you are looking for the theme directories already built, they are in `./out/dist/Dhumavati-Theme/`. To install them, `cd` there and run `sudo make install`

to ease the process of building the theme from its component files, there is a run script included that leverages Docker to build the theme and then output the results into a local directory, which can be called with:

```bash
./run-build.sh
```


## Inspiration

Mostly this is a color palette adaption of [Skeuos GTK](https://github.com/daniruiz/skeuos-gtk) to my personal color scheme *Vice*
