## Name

Dhumavati is the Tantric Goddess of Death often conflated with Alakshmi, Goddess of Misfortune and sister to the Goddess of Fortune, Lakshmi the Shakti of Lord Vishnu. 

Unlike Alakshmi, Dhumavati is not inauspicious, but She reminds us that our time is coming and not to waste it, much like Kali-Ma.
